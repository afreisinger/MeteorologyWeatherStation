Hi, I should add this to the documentation, but for now here are instructions to set up softSPI, which should work with the required pins. 
Seems strange they didn't use the hardware SPI pins for the RF24 connector, but I bet it is related to the wiznet module issue referenced in the thread linked below.

SoftSPI

Install the digitalIO library
Open RF24_config.h in a text editor. Uncomment the line #define SOFTSPI
In your sketch, add #include DigitalIO.h
Note: Pins are listed as follows and can be modified in the RF24_config.h file
const uint8_t SOFT_SPI_MISO_PIN = 16;
const uint8_t SOFT_SPI_MOSI_PIN = 15;
const uint8_t SOFT_SPI_SCK_PIN = 14;

See TMRh20#24 for more info
